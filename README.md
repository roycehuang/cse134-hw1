### Question 1
1. Were any parts of navigating ESPN site easy? Were any parts difficult?
- yes, the ESPN site was incredibly content heavy and I could not find the heading. Navigating the different headings was easy, but searching for the one I wanted took an incredibly long time.
2. Were any parts of navigating webaim.org's site easy? Were any parts difficult?
- This website was very simply structured, but the text blocks were very long which made searching for things take a long time
